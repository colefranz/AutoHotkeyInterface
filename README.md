### Running the app
* `npm install`
* `npm run start`


### Development Lingo
Mostly for my own benefit..
* Script: Internal lingo for the text that creates and ahk file. Outward facing we use the word File.
* Shortcut: The keystroke to trigger Hotkeys
* Hotkey: An action that occurs when a shortcut is used. Multiple (or a singular) make up a shortcut.
