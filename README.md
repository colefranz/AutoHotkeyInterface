## Installation
Windows only as AutoHotkey (AHK) is only supported on windows.
Navigate to the [release tab](https://github.com/colefranz/AutoHotkeyInterface/releases) and install the latest `.exe` file.
If this is your first time using AHK you will need to also install and the steps to do so can be found [here](https://autohotkey.com/download/).

Basic steps for how to use the application are:
* Run the setup to install the application, it should open automatically
* Create an AHK script that satisfies your needs by using the application and save it locally.
* Double click on the generated script to run it.
* Done!

## Development

### Running the app
* `npm install`
* `npm run start`


### Development Lingo
Mostly for my own benefit..
* Script: Internal lingo for the text that creates and ahk file. Outward facing we use the word File.
* Shortcut: The keystroke to trigger Hotkeys
* Hotkey: An action that occurs when a shortcut is used. Multiple (or a singular) make up a shortcut.
